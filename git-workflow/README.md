## Overview

Follow the simple branching model recommended by [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). Each feature or fix should be in its own branch. Branches should be named as descriptively as possible. 

When finished with development on a branch, merge update to master into your branch (if any exist), and test. Code in master should always be deployable.

After testing, if discussion of a change is necessary create a pull request with your changes. If no discussion is necessary merge the code into master and delete your branch.
